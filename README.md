# Why private equity is everywhere, and what are the consequences?

Methodology: For the first chart, a slope chart, I looked at SEC company filings from the four biggest publicly traded private equity firms (they also invest in other alternative assets, but are often classified as private equity firms) and how much of private equity assets they managed.

For the second chart, where I showed multiple pie charts, I looked at data compiled by the Equable Institute on the allocations of public pension funds in the U.S. to private equity, and chose the five pension funds that allocated the most to private equity, according to the American Investment Council.

Making these charts were new to me â€” I didn't really know how to use them before we had a lecture on ways to show proportion over time, so I'm glad I got the chance to make them. I used Flourish and Rawgraphs, and exported the svg files to Adobe Illustrator to tweak them. 

It was my first time making a narrative game too. I looked at prices listed on the company's online store and pictures of menus to make it. 
Using Twine was quite intuitive, although I don't know how to rename different pages in the same name (i.e. There are different tallies even though a player ends up choosing the same type of product at the end as someone else, so there needs to be two different pages) so I ended up numbering the choices.
